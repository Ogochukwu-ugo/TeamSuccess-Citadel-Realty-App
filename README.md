# Ada Project Collaboration Task - Citadel Realty App

## Overview
This is the first Wild Quest collaborative Ada Project task and it aims to train and build the students to be both technically and people oriented.


## Project Overview

The Citadel Realty App is a Real Estate Web Application that aims to alleviate the difficulties of spending so much time, money, and effort searching for homes that suit an individual's preferences.
The app will address these issues by allowing people to search for homes without wasting time, effort, or money. It will allow them to view homes in various areas that meet their needs, preferences, and budget.

## The Building Process
In building the web app, I and my teammate used several tools for building. The building process was really a wild quest just as the name implies. Although we were always rushing to meet up the deadline, we still tried to make the app to look close to the design we received from the product designer.

To set up the development environment, I did the following:
Created the product folder on my desktop,
Created HTML, CSS, JS, gitignore and README files which I inputted into the product folder,
Created the product's GitHub repository were I pushed the product folder to.
Created the products' Vercel and Netify production account where the product will be viewed.
Signed up on Firebase so I could get the required resources for the product development.

Top properly build the product, I used the following tools:
VS Code Editor,
Bootstrap framework,
Firebase.



The following steps are the building processes which I used to achieve the working product.

Opened VS  code on my PC,
Opened the product folder from the vs code,
Opened the HTML file, 
Added the html boiler plate to the file,
Linked the CSS file to the HTML head tag,
Linked the bootstrap framework to the HTML head tag,
Imported the Firebase files to the JS files,
Linked the JS files to the HTML body tag,
Started inputting the HTML semantic tags which would make the structuring of the web pages successful.
Used the CSS and Bootstrap for dynamic lay outing and beautification of the web pages,
Used JS for the dynamic interactions of the web pages,
Used Firebase for the sign up and login validation and authentication.
